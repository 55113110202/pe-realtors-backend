# Appwrite Login Issue - Resolved

## Issue
Login was failing with "Invalid credentials" error (401) even though the user existed in Appwrite.

## Root Cause
The password in the Appwrite database was different from the documented password.

## Solution
Reset the user password using Appwrite CLI:

```bash
appwrite users update-password --user-id mohands --password "Hical@1767"
```

## Verified Configuration

### User Details
- **User ID**: mohands
- **Email**: perealtorsit@gmail.com
- **Password**: Hical@1767 (now confirmed)
- **Name**: super admin
- **Status**: Active
- **Email Verified**: Yes
- **Phone Verified**: Yes

### Platform Configuration
- **Platform ID**: 68efe28fb5cbff4bc05c
- **Name**: Next.js app
- **Type**: web
- **Hostname**: localhost
- **Status**: Active

### Project Configuration
- **Project ID**: perealtors
- **Endpoint**: https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
- **Database ID**: propertiesDB

- **Bucket ID**: property_photos

## Login Should Now Work

The login credentials are now confirmed to be:
- **Email**: perealtorsit@gmail.com
- **Password**: Hical@1767

## Testing
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/signin`
2. Enter the credentials above
3. Login should succeed and redirect to dashboard

## Additional Notes
- Platform (localhost) is already whitelisted
- Email/password authentication is enabled
- User account is active and verified
- All services are enabled and running
